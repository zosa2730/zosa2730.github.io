### CPSC 120

Lab 8, part 1 
Was one of my favorites because it taught me how coding affects the restaurant environment. Learning the different types of situations to code for when someone chooses to make a sandwich. 
Like the different bread types, protein, and condiments, it was very interesting to see all the values and variables that take place. 
It helped me understand the inner working of applications where someone chooses their own meal for an online order. 

Lab 7, part 2
Was one of my favorites because it taught me about the way a parking application would work. 
Using many factors from the type of day or time it is using hours, minutes, and seconds. It was interesting to use “if statements” for the situations the parking signs were based on. 
Returning the statements was also very fun to learn how these lines of code can only pass given true or false. 

Lab 3, part 1
Was one of my favorites because it taught me about where to implement data types, specifically using double. 
As it was used for fractional and whole numbers with decimal points. Learning about how to implement it with the price of a pizza depending on its size. 
It was also very interesting to learn about how the program executes to print out messages using std::cout.
